# Spaghetti Carbonara

## Ingredients for 2 servings

- 200g ^[or whatever serving size your grocer sells] of smoked pancetta ^[bacon 
works too. Guanciale is most authentic but I find it hard to work with. You 
render soooo much fat from guanciale it's kinda insane], sliced to bite size bits
- 250g of spaghetti or linguine
- A block of grana padano or parmeggiano reggiano cheese and cheese grater
- Black pepper ^[preferably via pepper mill]
- 3 eggs and 1 egg yolk
- 3 cloves of diced garlic ^[only if you're not italian]

## Steps

1. Cook pasta according to instructions. Try to time it such that pasta is ready 
   10 minutes after start of step 2
2. Heat pork on medium/low pan with lid to render fat, stirring ocasionally. Add 
   garlic (if using) after some fat has been rendered out. Should take about 10 
   minutes to cook
3. Meanwhile lightly beat eggs and egg yolk in bowl. Grate as much cheese as you 
   can into bowl
4. Add copious amounts of black pepper to bowl and beat contents together until 
   mostly homogenous
5. The next two steps are very delicate. As soon as pasta is ready, pork should 
   be well cooked and rendered. Turn off all heat and transfer pasta to pan, 
   along with a splash of pasta water. Mix contents of pan
6. Take pan off hob. Add tiny bit of egg mixture to pan and stir. If egg 
   scrambles, pan is too hot so wait 10 seconds and try again. If egg doesn't 
   look to be scrambling, add bowl contents to pan and stir vigorously.
