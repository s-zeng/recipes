- 1/4 cup Chinese cooking wine ^[and about 2-3tbsp more for initial pork boil]
- Soy sauce
  - 2tbsp light
  - 2tbsp dark ^[4tbsp light altogether works just as well]

- 1 tsp of Sichuan peppercorns

1. Add pork belly to pan and cover with cold water. ^[if boiled eggs not ready 
   yet you can boil them with together with the pork] Add discarded+washed 
   scallion bits and dash of chinese cooking wine and bring to boil. Simmer for 
   5 minutes before sieving and draining, discarding water and aromatics
3. Add sugar to instant pot, set to saute on high, and stir constantly until it 
   turns dark amber in color (about 5 minutes)
3. Add pork and stir fry for 2-3 minutes until pork is slightly charred. Add all 
   aromatics and stir fry a few more minutes or until fragrant

5. Add soy sauce(s) and enough water to cover, about 2.5 cups. Pressure cook 30 minutes

   step, add 1tsp of corn starch and continue cooking with lid open until
