# Instant Pot Red Braised Pork Belly With Egg

## Ingredients for 2-3 servings

- 1 kg of pork belly with skin, cut into 1.5x2 inch rectangular prisms ^[2 inch parallel to muscle, 1.5 inch across muscle]
- 5 tbsp of chinese rock sugar ^[regular sugar works too but is harder to caramelize]
- Water
- 1/4 cup Chinese cooking wine ^[and about 2-3tbsp more for initial pork boil]
- Soy sauce
  - 2tbsp light
  - 2tbsp dark ^[4tbsp light altogether works just as well]
- Enough aromatics to cover bottom of instant pot
  - 10-12 roughly chopped scallions
  - 3-4 inches of ginger, sliced into thin pieces
- 6 eggs, softly boiled and peeled
- Fuzhu (tofu sticks) ^[if available]

### Aromatics Mise en Place ^[all aromatics besides scallion, garlic, and ginger are optional]
- 3 stalks of diced scallion whites ^[can take from instant-pot-covering 
aromatics]
- 6 slices of ginger ^[can take from instant-pot-covering aromatics]
- 5-6 cloves of peeled and crushed garlic
- 1 star anise
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 1 tsp of Sichuan peppercorns
- 2 small dried hot chile
- 1/4 of a nutmeg

## Steps

1. Add pork belly to pan and cover with cold water. Add discarded+washed 
   scallion bits and dash of chinese cooking wine and bring to boil. Simmer for 
   5 minutes before sieving and draining, discarding water and aromatics
2. Layer scallions and ginger across bottom of instant pot ^[this prevents 
   pork sticking to bottom]
3. Turn pan to medium low and stir fry pork for 5-6 minutes until a little bit 
   of fat is rendered and pork is slightly charred. Add all aromatics and stir 
   fry a few more minutes or until fragrant
4. Transfer pan contents to instant pot but keep a little bit of fat in the pan. 
   Add chinese cooking wine and soy sauce(s) to instant pot.
5. Score eggs with knife or poke holes with fork, and add on top of pork. Add 
   fuzhu if available
6. Add sugar to pan and stir constantly until it turns dark amber in color
7. Add a cup of water to pan to make homogeneous sugar water solution ^[to make 
   it easier to get all the carmalized sugar out], then transfer to instant pot
8. Add enough water to barely cover, about 2 more cups (its okay if stuff is 
   sticking out over water) ^[in fact less water than you think should be fine] 
   and pressure cook on high for 30 minutes
9. Release pressure and check contents. If you added too much water in the last 
   step, add 1tsp of corn starch and continue cooking with lid open until 
   desired texture is reached
